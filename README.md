# Computer Vision Datasets

Probably this exists elsewhere I guess but contributing there/making sure that its maintained is not easier than creating our own.
Making it comprehensive with full detailes takes time so will do it over time. Just wanted to create asap to log few uknown old datasets initally.
Some of the datasets has multiple tracks, like classification and segmentation and detection, so refer to the link from above categories if repeated.
Mostly in order of current significance which is directly proportional to challenging nature/size of dataset.

## Classification
